    "## 🎯 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **second paradigm** of multi-agent collaboration: **Peer-to-Peer Collaboration using Swarm**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this pattern, agents communicate with each other as equals, sharing information and working together without a central coordinator. Unlike the hierarchical \"Agent as Tools\" pattern, swarm agents collaborate in a more distributed and flexible manner.\n",

    "## 🔄 Summary: Peer-to-Peer Swarm Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've successfully implemented the **second paradigm** of multi-agent collaboration: **Peer-to-Peer Collaboration using Swarm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What We Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implemented Practical Swarm Examples**:\n",
    "   - ✅ Collaborative Content Creation (Writer, Editor, Fact-checker)\n",
    "   - ✅ Product Development Team (Designer, Developer, Tester)\n",
    "   - ✅ Custom Swarm Creation for any task\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Demonstrated Key Swarm Characteristics**:\n",
    "   - ✅ Peer-to-peer communication without hierarchy\n",
    "   - ✅ Iterative collaboration and improvement\n",
    "   - ✅ Specialized agent roles and expertise\n",
    "   - ✅ Collective decision-making processes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Built Advanced Utilities**:\n",
    "   - ✅ Custom swarm creation function\n",
    "   - ✅ Flexible swarm coordination patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔑 Key Advantages of Swarm Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distributed Intelligence**: No single point of failure\n",
    "- **Flexible Workflows**: Adaptive collaboration patterns\n",
    "- **Quality Through Diversity**: Multiple perspectives improve outcomes\n",
    "- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement cycles\n",
    "- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add or modify agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 When to Use Swarm Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Swarm collaboration is ideal for:\n",
    "- **Creative and analytical tasks** requiring diverse expertise\n",
    "- **Complex problem-solving** benefiting from multiple perspectives\n",
    "- **Quality-critical outputs** needing peer review and validation\n",
    "- **Collaborative workflows** where agents contribute equally\n",
    "- **Iterative improvement processes** requiring multiple refinement cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation provides a solid foundation for building sophisticated peer-to-peer agent collaboration systems. You can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Customize the examples** for your specific use cases\n",
    "2. **Experiment with different agent combinations** and roles\n",
    "3. **Integrate with your existing systems** and workflows\n",
    "4. **Scale up** to larger swarms with more specialized agents\n",
    "5. **Combine with other patterns** for hybrid multi-agent architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎉 Congratulations!** You've successfully implemented peer-to-peer swarm collaboration using Claude 3.7 Sonnet on Amazon Bedrock. This powerful pattern opens up new possibilities for building intelligent, collaborative AI systems.\n",
