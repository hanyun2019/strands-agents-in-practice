    "## Why Use Multiple Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several compelling reasons to design multi-agent systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specialization**: Each agent can excel at specific tasks using targeted tools and prompts\n",
    "2. **Modularity**: Easier to develop, test, and maintain separate components\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: Independent agents can work in parallel\n",
    "4. **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent can handle different aspects of a complex problem\n",
    "5. **Resilience**: If one agent fails, others can continue operating\n",

      "1. **Gross Margin Pressure**:\n",
      "   - The 3% quarterly decline in gross margin requires immediate attention\n",
      "   - Review cost structures and pricing strategies, especially for high-volume products\n",
      "   - Consider targeted price increases on high-margin items to offset cost increases\n",

      "   - This trend will erode profitability if it continues; optimize marketing channels and focus on higher-converting campaigns\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Product Portfolio Strategy**:\n",
      "   - Product Line A dominates revenue (49.0%) but evaluate its contribution to margin\n",
      "   - Product Line C has the smallest share (16.3%) - assess whether it delivers proportionate profitability or strategic value\n",
      "   - Consider allocating more resources to whichever product line has the highest margin contribution\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Strategic Priorities**:\n",
      "   - Address gross margin decline through cost optimization or strategic price adjustments\n",
